*"In this research paper, I aim to investigate the effect of skipping menstrual cycles on menstrual cycle length variability using a Poisson's regression model. Since ovulation and individual fertility windows are predicted based on the user's ususal mentrual cycle length, variability in the cycle length can significantly affect the fertilty prediction's accuracy. In addition, skipping of menstrual cycles by use of oral birth control is common among fertility tracker users. Therefore, gaining more insight into the relation between skipping cycles and cycle variability per individual will be valuable in interpreting and improving current fertility tracker's clinical accuracy."*
